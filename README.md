# Student-Grade-Management-System

  👋 Welcome to the repository for my **Final Project** in a C programming course. This project is a comprehensive **Student Grade Management System** developed entirely in the **C language**.

## Main Features 🗂️

- Add and display student details in the _**Students List**_.
- Add and display module details in the _**Modules List**_.
- Create a _**Grades List**_ with each record containing a student and  a module information along with component points.
- Calculate final grades and ratings based on component points.
- Sort grade records in decreasing order by final grade.
- Find students with final grades equal to a specified value in the _**Grades List**_.
- Read and write data of all _**Lists**_ to corresponding files.

_(For a full detailed explanation of features and a step-by-step guide on how the program works, please refer to the project's Wiki.)_

## Getting Started 🚩

1. Clone or download the repository:
   - If you choose to download only the `Final_C_Project_all_in_one_version.c` file, you'll have a long single C file. No additional IDE configuration is needed.
   - If you download all other files except that one, set up a folder containing these files in your IDE and configure the folder to run as a project in your IDE.

2. Create three blank files: `Student.TXT`, `Module.TXT`, and `Grade.TXT` in the same directory as the project files.

3. Explore and enjoy!
